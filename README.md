<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm NicolÃ¡s PeÃ±aloza</h1>
<h3 align="center">Fullstack software engineer</h3>

I am a Full-Stack Software Developer with almost four years of experience in PWA/Mobile/Web development, and more than ten years of studies in this field. I hold certifications in both F/E and B/E technologies, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Informatics Engineering. I am a people person, and I love working with others because there is always something new to learn from each of them, even when they have been in this world for less time than I have.

My F/E technology stack includes React, Angular, Ionic, StencilJS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, SocketIO, and WebSockets. On the B/E side, I am highly proficient in Python, NodeJS, PHP, Express, Firebase, and MySql, as well as experienced in C#, C++ and even more.

In addition, I have expertise in agile methodologies like Scrum, and version control tools like Git, BitBucket, Docker and more.

I am a highly motivated individual looking for challenging opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge, and collaborate with a like-minded team to deliver high-quality software solutions. If my profile aligns with your requirements, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for considering my profile. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
